Welcome to the official DankPods Community Discord guild, a place to discuss DankPods, audio gear, iPods and other topics. We hope you'll enjoy your stay here, but first off, we need you to read and abide by the rules listed below, as well as <#821190757003034716>.

**1. Respect**  
    Don't be racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist or otherwise engage in hate speech. You can curse, but just don't be a jerk to others. This includes offensive memes.

**2. Be mature**  
    Please act mature in any discussions here. Don't spam, or clog general up with unnecessary messages.

**3. Be inclusive**  
    If someone asks you to stop discussing a sensitive topic, stop. We're trying to make this a friendly place.

**4. Think before you type**  
    If you think a message might be offensive to others, just don't send it.

**5. Keep stuff to the correct channels**  
    For example, keep memes to <#821202010287898656>. It's fine if you post something better fitting to another channel to <#823939225123815475>, but don't clog up the channel. Take it to the relevant one or <#893335719785947176>. Also, keep <#858785895498514483> to serious discussion.

**6. Follow Discord TOS**  
    Every member here needs to follow the Discord Terms of Service, for example, their age requirement. (<https://discord.com/terms>)

**7. NSFW Content**  
    Keep Not Safe For Work content out of this guild. There are underage people here, and plus, it's not something most people want to see.

**8. Illegal Content**  
    We don't allow illegal content to be posted in this guild in any form, and will report it to the relevant authorities. This includes piracy, such as Patreon-exclusive content. Don't post links to it or direct files.

**9. Self-promotion**  
    Don't advertise your own content here. This includes streams, YT channels and Discord guild invites. This rule may not be enforced if the content is relevant to the discussion.

**10. Drama**  
    Don't bring drama from other communities here.
    
**11. Malware**  
    Malware is not allowed to be uploaded in this guild. This includes images with malware inside of them, since they may still trigger antimalware software.

**12. Politics**  
    Politics are not allowed in this server, since it usually devolves into arguments.
EDIT: As of 2022-02-24, there is an exception to this rule allowing certain discussion about the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. More info here: https://canary.discord.com/channels/821188708321198130/821202074527203369/946297300853067816

**13. Impersonation**  
    Impersonating people, including a moderator or DankPods, is not allowed.


**Punishment Guidance**
    Generally, we operate on a 3-strikes-you're-out system, starting with a warning, mute (length up to mod discretion) and finally a temporary or permanent ban.
However, this guidance might be broken according to the acting moderator. This means that, for example, if you clearly are joining just to troll, or are posting slurs/NSFW content, we may ban you on the spot, or, in the case of minimal rule breakage, we may give a non-strike verbal warning.

Automoderator warnings (e.g posting a blacklisted word) don't count as strikes, neither do "joke" infractions (e.g asked to be muted/warned). Normally, if you get a legitimate strike, we will append `(X/3)` to the infraction message. Strikes may also be removed at mod discretion for continued good behaviour.


**Credits**  
These rules have been based very heavily on /r/iPod's rules, written by <@490609510734364692>  and found at discord.gg/ipod, which in turn have been based off the GNU/FSF IRC rules, which can be found at <https://www.gnu.org/server/irc-rules.en.html>

**Disclaimer**  
Messages and other actions are logged by <@851055505724145684> in this guild. By sending a message, changing your nickname, or otherwise interacting in this guild, you consent to this. If you want a logged action deleted or more details, please contact a member of <@&821195811525885982>.
